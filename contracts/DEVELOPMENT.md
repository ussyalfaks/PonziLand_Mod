# PonziLand Development Guide

This document describes the main actions available in the PonziLand smart contract and how to interact with them from your frontend application.

## Game Overview

PonziLand is a blockchain-based game where players can own, trade, and earn from virtual land plots. Each land plot can be purchased using different tokens and generates taxes from neighboring lands. Players must maintain sufficient stake to avoid having their land "nuked" (forcefully removed).

## Core Actions

### Auction
Start a new auction for an unowned land plot. Auctions are the primary mechanism for distributing new land to players. The auction starts at a specified price and gradually decreases until it reaches the floor price or someone makes a bid.


### Bid
Place a bid on land that is currently being auctioned. When bidding, players must specify not only the purchase price but also an amount to stake as security against future tax obligations. The bid will immediately end the auction if successful.

**Key Concepts:**
- The bid price must match the current auction price
- Stake amount must be sufficient to prevent immediate nuking
- Successful bids transfer ownership immediately
- The specified token becomes the trading currency for that land

### Buy
Purchase a land plot directly from another player. This action is used for regular land trading after the initial auction. The buyer must pay the current selling price and provide stake for tax security.

**Important Considerations:**
- Must approve token spending before purchase
- Requires sufficient stake to be provided
- Automatically claims pending taxes for both buyer and seller
- Updates the land's 

### Claim
Collect and generate taxes from neighboring lands. Each land owner can claim taxes that have been generated by their neighbors. Taxes are calculated based on land value and time elapsed.

**Key Points:**
- Can be called at any time
- Automatically processes taxes for all neighboring lands
- trigger nuking of neighboring lands if they lack sufficient stake
- Distributes tax payments in the respective land's tokens

### Increase Price
Update the selling price of your land. Owners can increase their land's selling price at any time, which also affects the tax calculations for neighboring plots.

**Usage Notes:**
- New price must be higher than current price
- Affects future tax calculations
- Doesn't require additional stake

### Increase Stake
Add more stake to your land to prevent it from being nuked. Stake serves as security against tax obligations and must be maintained to keep ownership.

**Important Details:**
- Can be increased at any time
- Protects against nuking
- Stake is locked until land is sold
- Excess stake provides longer protection against nuking





## View Functions Overview

This section describes all the read-only functions (views) available in the PonziLand smart contract that allow you to query the current state of the game without modifying it.

### Get Land Information
Retrieves detailed information about any land plot in the game. This is one of the most fundamental view functions as it provides all essential data about a specific land plot.

**What it returns:**
- The exact location coordinates
- Current owner's address
- Current selling price
- Which token is used for transactions
- Associated liquidity pool
- Timestamps for last tax payment and purchase date

**When to use it:**
- Before making a purchase to verify land details
- To check if a land is owned or available
- For displaying land information in your interface
- To verify ownership before transactions
- When calculating potential tax obligations

### Get Stake Balance
Shows how much stake a specific address has locked in the game. This is crucial for understanding a player's position and risk level.

**Key aspects:**
- Displays total amount staked across all lands
- Helps players monitor their risk of being nuked
- Essential for calculating how much additional stake might be needed
- Used by the system to validate if lands can be nuked

**Important for:**
- Risk management
- Planning stake increases
- Monitoring account health
- Frontend displays of user status

### Get Pending Taxes
Provides a comprehensive view of all pending taxes for a land owner. This function returns an array of different tokens and their amounts that are waiting to be claimed.

**What you learn from it:**
- Total pending taxes across all tokens
- Which tokens are available to claim
- How much can be claimed for each token
- Overall tax earnings status

**Best used for:**
- Planning when to claim taxes
- Financial planning
- UI displays of earnings
- Risk assessment of neighboring lands

### Get Pending Taxes for Land
Similar to the general pending taxes function, but focused on a specific land plot. This is useful when you need to know the tax situation of a particular location.

**Use cases:**
- Before buying a specific land
- Monitoring individual land performance
- Planning tax claims for specific locations
- Evaluating neighbor profitability

### Get Current Auction Price
Shows the current price of an active auction for any land plot. This price decreases over time until someone makes a bid or it reaches the floor price.

**Important details:**
- Returns zero if there's no active auction
- Price decreases linearly over time
- Essential for timing auction bids
- Helps in planning purchase strategies

## Practical Applications
